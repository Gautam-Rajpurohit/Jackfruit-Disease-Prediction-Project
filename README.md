# Jackfruit Disease Prediction using Few-Shot Learning

This project is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect diseases in jackfruit leaves using Few-Shot Learning. It utilizes a Prototypical Network built on top of a pre-trained DenseNet121/ResNet18 model to classify images into three categories:

- Healthy
- Algae Leaf Spot Disease
- Black Spot Disease

## Project Highlights

- **Few-Shot Learning**: Minimal data requirement using episodic training.
- **Image Classification**: Classifies jackfruit leaf images into 3 distinct classes.
- **DenseNet121 + Prototypical Network**: High-quality feature extraction with few-shot classification.
- **Flask Web App**: Simple UI to upload images and view disease predictions.
- **Confidence Score**: Provides prediction accuracy (%) for better trust.
